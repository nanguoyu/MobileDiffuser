# Reproducing Model Resources

This guide explains how to reproduce the current MobileDiffuser model setup.
The app no longer uses generated Core ML folders. Runtime weights are public
MLX/Hugging Face checkpoints downloaded by the app or by the engine packages.

Model weights are not committed to this repository.

## Repository Layout

During development the app expects sibling checkouts:

```text
~/code/
  MobileDiffuser/
  z-image-swift-mlx/
  flux2-diffusion-engine/
  swift-diffusion-core/      optional local clone; app normally sees remote git revision
  flux-2-swift-mlx/          optional, resolved by flux2-diffusion-engine
```

Clone the public repos:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanguoyu/MobileDiffuser
git clone https://github.com/nanguoyu/z-image-swift-mlx
git clone https://github.com/nanguoyu/flux2-diffusion-engine
```

Open `MobileDiffuser.xcodeproj`. The app links `../z-image-swift-mlx` and
`AppEngines`; `AppEngines` links `../../flux2-diffusion-engine`.

## App Download Path

The normal user flow is in-app download:

1. Run the app.
2. Open Models.
3. Select a model and recipe.
4. Download the missing components.
5. Generate.

Z-Image downloads into the app's Application Support directory through
`ModelDownloader`. FLUX.2 components are managed by `Flux2FacadeEngine` and the
underlying FLUX package.

Settings shows the exact storage location used by the app.

## Model Sources

### Z-Image Turbo

```text
repo: deepsweet/Z-Image-Turbo-6B-MLX-Q4
layout:
  text_encoder/*.safetensors
  transformer/*.safetensors
  vae/*.safetensors
  tokenizer/*
approx size: 5.9 GB
```

The downloader considers the model installed only when every component index
file exists, every shard referenced by each index exists, and no
`*.incomplete` markers remain.

### FLUX.2 Klein

The app manages FLUX as separate recipe components:

```text
transformer 16-bit: black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B
transformer 8-bit:  black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B
transformer 4-bit:  mlx-community/flux2-klein-4b-4bit
Qwen3 encoder 8-bit: lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-MLX-8bit
Qwen3 encoder 4-bit: lmstudio-community/Qwen3-4B-MLX-4bit
small decoder:       black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-small-decoder
standard VAE:        black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B
```

The 4-bit transformer path uses the pre-quantized checkpoint. It must load
packed 4-bit weights directly, not bf16 weights followed by load-time
quantization.

## Building the App

Set local signing without committing your Team ID:

```bash
cp Signing.xcconfig.example Signing.xcconfig
# edit Signing.xcconfig and set DEVELOPMENT_TEAM
```

Build for macOS:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project MobileDiffuser.xcodeproj \
  -scheme MobileDiffuser \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  build
```

Build for iOS without signing:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project MobileDiffuser.xcodeproj \
  -scheme MobileDiffuser \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  build
```

For device deployment, use Xcode with a valid signing team and an installed iOS
SDK compatible with the device OS.

## CLI Validation

The engine repos include small CLIs for model-level validation.

### Z-Image

```bash
cd ../z-image-swift-mlx
swift run zimage-demo <model-dir> "a red panda on a mossy rock" 1024 8 out.png
```

`<model-dir>` is a local checkout/download of
`deepsweet/Z-Image-Turbo-6B-MLX-Q4`.

### FLUX.2

```bash
cd ../flux2-diffusion-engine
swift run flux2-demo "a red panda on a mossy rock"
```

For `swift run`, MLX may not find its Metal library. The most reliable path is
to run through Xcode. If using CLI, copy an Xcode-built MLX
`default.metallib` to `mlx.metallib` next to the built executable and ensure the
executable has `/usr/lib` on its rpath. The demo targets already include the
rpath fix.

## Tests

Use Xcode/xcodebuild for MLX package tests when possible. Plain `swift test`
often fails in MLX packages because the CLI test runner does not automatically
bundle `default.metallib`.

Useful test groups:

```text
swift-diffusion-core:
  sampler schedule
  memory governor
  MLXDiffusionEngine resident vs streaming lifecycle
  RangedFileWeightSource

z-image-swift-mlx:
  component source routing
  per-block load equivalence
  streaming block lifecycle
  optional real-checkpoint streaming parity
```

The real-checkpoint Z-Image parity test is opt-in. Set:

```bash
ZIMAGE_CHECKPOINT=/path/to/Z-Image-Turbo-6B-MLX-Q4
```

It compares resident and streamed denoise results on the same checkpoint.

## Device Validation

For iPhone runs, collect:

```text
device model:
iOS version:
Xcode version:
model:
recipe:
size:
steps:
seed:
generation time:
peak resident memory shown in Create:
thermal state, if known:
jetsam log, if any:
```

Expected current validated paths:

```text
Z-Image Turbo:
  iPhone 16 Pro
  block streaming
  512px default
  about 2.2 GB measured peak in the validated run

FLUX.2 Klein:
  iPhone 16 Pro
  4-bit transformer, 4-bit encoder, small decoder
  512px, 4 steps
  about 4.3 GB peak, about 1m11s
```

1024px on iPhone should be treated as experimental, especially with the FLUX
standard VAE.

## Cleanup

Delete downloaded weights from the app's Models screen or Settings -> Manage
models. For package CLI experiments, delete the local Hugging Face model folders
you downloaded manually.

Do not commit:

- model weights,
- `.safetensors` files,
- generated images,
- `Signing.xcconfig`,
- Xcode user data.
